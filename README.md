# Single_Cycle_Core

A **Verilog** implementation of a **single-cycle processor** (5-stage design) for FPGA deployment.  
This repository contains modules covering each pipeline stage (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB), accompanying test benches, and memory initialization files.

## üß† Design Overview

This is a 5-stage single-cycle architecture:

1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**  
   - Fetches instruction from instruction memory using PC  
   - Increments PC  

2. **ID (Instruction Decode / Register Fetch)**  
   - Decodes the instruction  
   - Reads register operands  
   - Sign-extends immediates  

3. **EX (Execute / ALU)**  
   - Performs arithmetic or logic operations  
   - Calculates branch target, compares for branch decisions  

4. **MEM (Memory Access)**  
   - For `lw` / `sw`, reads or writes data memory  

5. **WB (Write Back)**  
   - Writes results back to the register file  

The **top-level module** wires all these stages together and handles the clock, reset, and inter-stage control.

Test benches for individual stages and for the full design help validate correctness.

Memory files (`*.mem`) are used to initialize instruction and data memory contents for simulation.

The `Basys3_Top_5stage.v` file is a board wrapper, intended for deployment on **Basys3 FPGA** (Artix-7) with appropriate I/O mapping.

## üß™ Running Simulations & Synthesis

### Simulation (Behavioral)

1. Load the top-level testbench `Single_Cycle_Top_5Stage_tb.v` in your simulator (e.g. ModelSim, Vivado Simulator).
2. Ensure memory initialization files are in path.
3. Run simulation and observe waveforms, check correctness of pipeline behavior.

### FPGA Deployment (Basys3)

- Use `Basys3_Top_5stage.v` as the top module.
- Map I/O pins in your FPGA constraints file (XDC) accordingly.
- Synthesize and generate bitstream.
- Program the Basys3 board and test the core with real inputs / outputs or through simulation-controlled memory content.

## üöÄ How to Use / Steps

1. Edit or write your instruction sequence in `instructions.mem`.
2. Provide initial data in `data_mem.mem` (if needed).
3. Run simulation or program FPGA.
4. Observe correct execution via waveforms or board I/O / LEDs / outputs.
5. To extend or test further, you can add new instructions or modules.

## üîç Possible Extensions & Future Work

- Add support for more instructions (e.g. `jal`, `jr`, `addi` etc)
- Introduce hazard detection, forwarding, stalling for pipelining
- Add branching, jump, and control instructions
- Support interrupts or I/O peripherals
- Increase performance, or convert to a pipelined or multi-cycle design
